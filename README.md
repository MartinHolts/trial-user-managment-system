## I ran json file in localhost with json-server.
### To run json server:
1. Install json-server globally using npm. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:<br />
npm install -g json-server

This will install json-server globally on your system.

2. Start json-server by running the following command in your project directory:<br />
json-server --watch db.json

This command starts json-server and watches the db.json file for changes.

3. You can now access the data from the users endpoint by navigating to http://localhost:3000/users in your browser. This should display the JSON data you defined in db.json.

To compile SCSS code I used SASS.

### To run SCSS code:
1. Install SASS globally using npm. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:<br />
npm install -g sass

This will install SASS globally on your system.

2. Start SASS by running the following command in your project directory:<br />
sass --watch scss:css

3. Sass now compiles all the code in scss folder into css folder when changes are made.
